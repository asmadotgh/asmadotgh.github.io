  abstract={Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) can help explain models' behavior and verify their alignment with human values. Given the capabilities of LLMs in generating human-understandable text, we propose leveraging the model itself to explain its internal representations in natural language. We introduce a framework called Patchscopes and show how it can be used to answer a wide range of questions about an LLM's computation. We show that many prior interpretability methods based on projecting representations into the vocabulary space and intervening on the LLM computation can be viewed as instances of this framework. Moreover, several of their shortcomings such as failure in inspecting early layers or lack of expressivity can be mitigated by Patchscopes. Beyond unifying prior inspection techniques, Patchscopes also opens up new possibilities such as using a more capable model to explain the representations of a smaller model, and self-correction in multihop reasoning, even outperforming chain-of-thought prompting.},

  title={Does localization inform editing? surprising differences in causality-based localization vs. knowledge editing in language models},
  abstract={Language models learn a great quantity of factual information during pretraining, and recent work localizes this information to specific model weights like mid-layer MLP weights. In this paper, we find that we can change how a fact is stored in a model by editing weights that are in a different location than where existing methods suggest that the fact is stored. This is surprising because we would expect that localizing facts to specific model parameters would tell us where to manipulate knowledge in models, and this assumption has motivated past work on model editing methods. Specifically, we show that localization conclusions from representation denoising (also known as Causal Tracing) do not provide any insight into which model MLP layer would be best to edit in order to override an existing stored fact with a new one. This finding raises questions about how past work relies on Causal Tracing to select which model layers to edit. Next, we consider several variants of the editing problem, including erasing and amplifying facts. For one of our editing problems, editing performance does relate to localization results from representation denoising, but we find that which layer we edit is a far better predictor of performance. Our results suggest, counterintuitively, that better mechanistic understanding of how pretrained language models work may not always translate to insights about how to best change their behavior.},

  title={Interpretability illusions in the generalization of simplified models},
  abstract={A common method to study deep learning systems is to create simplified representations---for example, using singular value decomposition to visualize the model's hidden states in a lower dimensional space. This approach assumes that the simplified model is faithful to the original model. Here, we illustrate an important caveat to this assumption: even if a simplified representation of the model can accurately approximate the original model on the training set, it may fail to match its behavior out of distribution; the understanding developed from simplified representations may be an illusion. We illustrate this by training Transformer models on controlled datasets with systematic generalization splits, focusing on the Dyck balanced-parenthesis languages. We simplify these models using tools like dimensionality-reduction and clustering, and find clear patterns in the resulting representations. We then explicitly test how these simplified proxy models match the original models behavior on various out-of-distribution test sets. Generally, the simplified proxies are less faithful out of distribution. For example, in cases where the original model generalizes to novel structures or deeper depths, the simplified model may fail to generalize, or may generalize too well. We then show the generality of these results: even model simplifications that do not directly use data can be less faithful out of distribution, and other tasks can also yield generalization gaps. Our experiments raise questions about the extent to which mechanistic interpretations derived using tools like SVD can reliably predict what a model will do in novel situations.},

  title={Comparing Representational and Functional Similarity in Small Transformer Language Models},
  abstract={In many situations, it would be helpful to be able to characterize the solution learned by a neural network, including for answering scientific questions (e.g. how do architecture changes affect generalization) and addressing practical concerns (e.g. auditing for potentially unsafe behavior). One approach is to try to understand these models by studying the representations that they learn---for example, comparing whether two networks learn similar representations. However, it is not always clear how much representation-level analyses can tell us about how a model makes predictions. In this work, we explore this question in the context of small Transformer language models, which we train on a synthetic, hierarchical language task. We train models with different sizes and random initializations, evaluating performance over the course of training and on a variety of systematic generalization splits. We find that existing methods for measuring representation similarity are not always correlated with behavioral metrics---i.e. models with similar representations do not always make similar predictions---and the results vary depending on the choice of representation. Our results highlight the importance of understanding representations in terms of the role they play in the neural algorithm.},

  title={Post Hoc Explanations of Language Models Can Improve Language Models},
  abstract={Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in performing complex tasks. Moreover, recent research has shown that incorporating human-annotated rationales (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) during in-context learning can significantly enhance the performance of these models, particularly on tasks that require reasoning capabilities. However, incorporating such rationales poses challenges in terms of scalability as this requires a high degree of human involvement. In this work, we present a novel framework, Amplifying Model Performance by Leveraging In-Context Learning with Post Hoc Explanations (AMPLIFY), which addresses the aforementioned challenges by automating the process of rationale generation. To this end, we leverage post hoc explanation methods which output attribution scores (explanations) capturing the influence of each of the input features on model predictions. More specifically, we construct automated natural language rationales that embed insights from post hoc explanations to provide corrective signals to LLMs. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets demonstrates that our framework, AMPLIFY, leads to prediction accuracy improvements of about 10-25% over a wide range of tasks, including those where prior approaches which rely on human-annotated rationales such as Chain-of-Thought prompting fall short. Our work makes one of the first attempts at highlighting the potential of post hoc explanations as valuable tools for enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct additional empirical analyses and ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of each of the components of AMPLIFY, which, in turn, lead to critical insights for refining in context learning.},

  title={DISSECT: Disentangled simultaneous explanations via concept traversals},
  abstract={Explaining deep learning model inferences is a promising venue for scientific understanding, improving safety, uncovering hidden biases, evaluating fairness, and beyond, as argued by many scholars. One of the principal benefits of counterfactual explanations is allowing users to explore "what-if" scenarios through what does not and cannot exist in the data, a quality that many other forms of explanation such as heatmaps and influence functions are inherently incapable of doing. However, most previous work on generative explainability cannot disentangle important concepts effectively, produces unrealistic examples, or fails to retain relevant information. We propose a novel approach, DISSECT, that jointly trains a generator, a discriminator, and a concept disentangler to overcome such challenges using little supervision. DISSECT generates Concept Traversals (CTs), defined as a sequence of generated examples with increasing degrees of concepts that influence a classifier's decision. By training a generative model from a classifier's signal, DISSECT offers a way to discover a classifier's inherent "notion" of distinct concepts automatically rather than rely on user-predefined concepts. We show that DISSECT produces CTs that (1) disentangle several concepts, (2) are influential to a classifier's decision and are coupled to its reasoning due to joint training (3), are realistic, (4) preserve relevant information, and (5) are stable across similar inputs. We validate DISSECT on several challenging synthetic and realistic datasets where previous methods fall short of satisfying desirable criteria for interpretability and show that it performs consistently well. Finally, we present experiments showing applications of DISSECT for detecting potential biases of a classifier and identifying spurious artifacts that impact predictions.},

  title={Approximating interactive human evaluation with self-play for open-domain dialog systems},
  abstract={Building an open-domain conversational agent is a challenging problem. Current evaluation methods, mostly post-hoc judgments of static conversation, do not capture conversation quality in a realistic interactive context. In this paper, we investigate interactive human evaluation and provide evidence for its necessity; we then introduce a novel, model-agnostic, and dataset-agnostic method to approximate it. In particular, we propose a self-play scenario where the dialog system talks to itself and we calculate a combination of proxies such as sentiment and semantic coherence on the conversation trajectory. We show that this metric is capable of capturing the human-rated quality of a dialog model better than any automated metric known to-date, achieving a significant Pearson correlation (r>.7, p<.05). To investigate the strengths of this novel metric and interactive evaluation in comparison to state-of-the-art metrics and human evaluation of static conversations, we perform extended experiments with a set of models, including several that make novel improvements to recent hierarchical dialog generation architectures through sentiment and semantic knowledge distillation on the utterance level. Finally, we open-source the interactive evaluation platform we built and the dataset we collected to allow researchers to efficiently deploy and evaluate dialog models.},

  author={Jaques*, Natasha and Shen*, Judy Hanwen and Ghandeharioun, Asma and Ferguson, Craig and Lapedriza, Agata and Jones, Noah and Gu, Shixiang Shane and Picard, Rosalind},
  abstract={How can we train a dialog model to produce better conversations by learning from human feedback, without the risk of humans teaching it harmful chat behaviors? We start by hosting models online, and gather human feedback from real-time, open-ended conversations, which we then use to train and improve the models using offline reinforcement learning (RL). We identify implicit conversational cues including language similarity, elicitation of laughter, sentiment, and more, which indicate positive human feedback, and embed these in multiple reward functions. A well-known challenge is that learning an RL policy in an offline setting usually fails due to the lack of ability to explore and the tendency to make over-optimistic estimates of future reward. These problems become even harder when using RL for language models, which can easily have a 20,000 action vocabulary and many possible reward functions. We solve the challenge by developing a novel class of offline RL algorithms. These algorithms use KL-control to penalize divergence from a pre-trained prior language model, and use a new strategy to make the algorithm pessimistic, instead of optimistic, in the face of uncertainty. We test the resulting dialog model with ratings from 80 users in an open-domain setting and find it achieves significant improvements over existing deep offline RL approaches. The novel offline RL method is viable for improving any existing generative dialog model using a static dataset of human feedback.},

  title={Hierarchical reinforcement learning for open-domain dialog},
  abstract={Open-domain dialog generation is a challenging problem; maximum likelihood training can lead to repetitive outputs, models have difficulty tracking long-term conversational goals, and training on standard movie or online datasets may lead to the generation of inappropriate, biased, or offensive text. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework that could potentially address these issues, for example by allowing a dialog model to optimize for reducing toxicity and repetitiveness. However, previous approaches which apply RL to open-domain dialog generation do so at the word level, making it difficult for the model to learn proper credit assignment for long-term conversational rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning, VHRL, which uses policy gradients to tune the utterance-level embedding of a variational sequence model. This hierarchical approach provides greater flexibility for learning long-term, conversational rewards. We use self-play and RL to optimize for a set of human-centered conversation metrics, and show that our approach provides significant improvements -- in terms of both human evaluation and automatic metrics -- over state-of-the-art dialog models, including Transformers.},

  title={Way off-policy batch deep reinforcement learning of implicit human preferences in dialog},
  abstract={Most deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems are not able to learn effectively from off-policy data, especially if they cannot explore online in the environment. These are critical shortcomings for applying RL to real-world problems where collecting data is expensive, and models must be tested offline before being deployed to interact with the environment -- e.g. systems that learn from human interaction. Thus, we develop a novel class of off-policy batch RL algorithms, which are able to effectively learn offline, without exploring, from a fixed batch of human interaction data. We leverage models pre-trained on data as a strong prior, and use KL-control to penalize divergence from this prior during RL training. We also use dropout-based uncertainty estimates to lower bound the target Q-values as a more efficient alternative to Double Q-Learning. The algorithms are tested on the problem of open-domain dialog generation -- a challenging reinforcement learning problem with a 20,000-dimensional action space. Using our Way Off-Policy algorithm, we can extract multiple different reward functions post-hoc from collected human interaction data, and learn effectively from all of these. We test the real-world generalization of these systems by deploying them live to converse with humans in an open-domain setting, and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves significant improvements over prior methods in off-policy batch RL.},

  abstract={Supporting model interpretability for complex phenomena where annotators can legitimately disagree, such as emotion recognition, is a challenging machine learning task. In this work, we show that explicitly quantifying the uncertainty in such settings has interpretability benefits. We use a simple modification of a classical network inference using Monte Carlo dropout to give measures of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. We identify a significant correlation between aleatoric uncertainty and human annotator disagreement (r≈.3). Additionally, we demonstrate how difficult and subjective training samples can be identified using aleatoric uncertainty and how epistemic uncertainty can reveal data bias that could result in unfair predictions. We identify the total uncertainty as a suitable surrogate for model calibration, i.e. the degree we can trust model's predicted confidence. In addition to explainability benefits, we observe modest performance boosts from incorporating model uncertainty.},

A conversational chatbot is a promising oracle for delivering appropriate just-in-time interventions. However, designing emotionally-aware agents, specially in this context, is under-explored. Furthermore, the feasibility of automating the delivery of just-in-time mHealth interventions via such an agent has not been fully studied. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of EMMA (EMotion-Aware mHealth Agent) through a two-week long human-subject experiment with N=39 participants. EMMA provides emotionally appropriate micro-activities in an empathetic manner. We show that the system can be extended to detect a user's mood purely from smartphone sensor data. Our results show that our personalized machine learning model was perceived as likable via self-reports of emotion from users. Finally, we provide a set of guidelines for the design of emotion-aware bots for mHealth.},

  title={Towards Human-Centered Optimality Criteria},
  abstract={Despite the transformational success of machine learning across various applications, examples of deployed models failing to recognize and support human-centered (HC) criteria are abundant. In this thesis, I conceptualize the space of human-machine collaboration with respect to two components: interpretation of people by machines and interpretation of machines by people. I develop several tools that make improvements along these axes. First, I develop a pipeline that predicts depressive symptoms rated by clinicians from real-world longitudinal data outperforming several baselines. Second, I introduce a novel, model-agnostic, and dataset-agnostic method to approximate interactive human evaluation in open-domain dialog through self-play that is more strongly correlated with human evaluations than other automated metrics commonly used today. While dialog quality evaluation metrics predominantly use word-level overlap or distance metrics based on embedding resemblance to each turn of the conversation, I show the significance of taking into account the conversation's trajectory and using proxies such as sentiment, semantics, and user engagement that are psychologically motivated. Third, I demonstrate an uncertainty measurement technique that helps disambiguate annotator disagreement and data bias. I show that this characterization also improves model performance. Finally, I present a novel method that allows humans to investigate a predictor's decision-making process to gain better insight into how it works. The method jointly trains a generator, a discriminator, and a concept disentangler, allowing the human to ask "what-if" questions. I evaluate it on several challenging synthetic and realistic datasets where previous methods fall short of satisfying desirable criteria for interpretability and show that our method performs consistently well across all. I discuss its applications to detect potential biases of a classifier and identify spurious artifacts that impact predictions using simulated experiments. Together, these novel techniques and insights provide a more comprehensive interpretation of people by machines and more powerful tools for interpretation of machines by people that can move us closer to HC optimality.},
