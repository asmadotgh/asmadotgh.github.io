I am Asma Ghandeharioun, a senior research scientist in Google DeepMind. I work on aligning AI with human values through better understanding [<a href="https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/patchscopes/">1</a>] and controlling (language) models [<a href="/assets/pdf/2928_post_hoc_explanations_of_langu.pdf">2</a>], and uniquely by demystifying their inner workings [<a href="https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking/">3</a>] and correcting collective misconceptions along the way [<a href="/assets/pdf/13353_does_localization_inform_editi.pdf">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03656">5</a>].

I received my <a href="/assets/pdf/ghandeharioun-asma_gh-phd-MAS-2021-thesis.pdf">Ph.D.</a> from the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/affective-computing/overview/">Affective Computing Group</a>, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a>. I am fortunate to have had <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/picard/overview/">Roz</a> as my advisor. In addition, I have had research experiences at Google Research, Microsoft Research, and EPFL, many of which have evolved into exciting long-term collaborations.
