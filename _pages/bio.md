Asma Ghandeharioun, M.Sc., Ph.D. is a senior research scientist at the <a href="https://google.ai/pair/">People + AI research</a> team in Google DeepMind.  She works on aligning AI with human values through better understanding [<a href="https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/patchscopes/">1</a>] and controlling (language) models [<a href="/assets/pdf/2928_post_hoc_explanations_of_langu.pdf">2</a>], and uniquely by demystifying their inner workings [<a href="https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking/">3</a>] and correcting collective misconceptions along the way [<a href="/assets/pdf/13353_does_localization_inform_editi.pdf">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03656">5</a>]. While her current research is mostly focused on machine learning interpretability, her previous work spans conversational AI, affective computing, digital health, and, more broadly, human-centered AI. She holds a doctorate and master's degree from MIT and a bachelor's degree from the Sharif University of Technology. She has been trained as a computer scientist/engineer and has research experiences at MIT, Google Research, Microsoft Research, EPFL, and in collaboration with medical professionals from Harvard, renowned hospitals in the Boston area, and abroad.

Her work has been published in premier peer-reviewed machine learning and digital health venues such as ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, EMNLP, AAAI, ACII, AISTATS, Frontiers in Psychiatry, and Psychology of Well-being, has received awards in NeurIPS, and has been featured in Wired, Wall Street Journal, and New Scientist.
