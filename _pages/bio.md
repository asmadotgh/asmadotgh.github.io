Asma Ghandeharioun, Ph.D., is a senior research scientist with the <a href="https://google.ai/pair/">People + AI Research</a> team at Google DeepMind. She works on aligning AI with human values through better understanding [<a href="https://pair-code.github.io/interpretability/patchscopes/">1</a>] and controlling (language) models [<a href="/assets/pdf/2928_post_hoc_explanations_of_langu.pdf">2</a>], uniquely by demystifying their inner workings [<a href="https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking/">3</a>] and correcting collective misconceptions along the way [<a href="/assets/pdf/13353_does_localization_inform_editi.pdf">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03656">5</a>]. While her current research is mostly focused on machine learning interpretability, her previous work spans conversational AI, affective computing, and, more broadly, human-centered AI. She holds a doctorate and master's degree from MIT and a bachelor's degree from the Sharif University of Technology. She has been trained as a computer scientist/engineer and has research experience at MIT, Google Research, Microsoft Research, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), to name a few.

Her work has been published in premier peer-reviewed machine learning venues such as ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, NAACL, EMNLP, AAAI, ACII, and AISTATS. She has received awards at NeurIPS and her work has been featured in Wired, Wall Street Journal, and New Scientist.
