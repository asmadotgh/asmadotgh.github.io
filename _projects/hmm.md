<p>We develop a simple hierarchical infinite HMM (iHMM) model, an extension to (iHMM) with an efficient inference scheme. The model can capture the dynamics of a sequence in two timescales and does not suffer from the problems of other related models in terms of implementation and time complexity.</p>
